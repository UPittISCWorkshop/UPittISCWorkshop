						<h3>Biography</h3>
						<p>Paul R. Ohodnicki is an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and
							Materials Science at the University of Pittsburgh. He received his Ph.D. in Materials
							Science and Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2008, after which he joined PPG
							Industries R&D working on thin-film coating materials and earned the Advanced Manufacturing
							and Materials Innovation Award from Carnegie Science Center in 2012. Ohodnicki later
							continued his career at the DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), where he
							eventually served as a technical portfolio lead guiding teams of materials scientists
							working on the development of optical and microwave sensors as well as magnetic materials
							and power electronics development for high frequency transformer based solar PV / energy
							storage inverters. </p>
						<p>Ohodnicki has published more than 140 technical publications and holds more than 10 patents,
							with more than 15 additional patents under review.
							He is the recipient of the 2016 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and
							Engineers, the highest honor the federal government can bestow on early-career scientists or
							engineers.
							He also is the recipient of several other awards and recognitions, including the Federal
							Employee Rookie of the Year Award (2012),
							the Advanced Manufacturing and Materials Innovation Category Award for the Carnegie Science
							Center (2012, 2017, 2019) and in 2017 he was a nominee for the Samuel J. Heyman service to
							America Medal.
							Before joining the University of Pittsburgh as an Associate Professor,
							he received the 2019 R&D 100 Award owing to his work on cobalt-rich metal amorphous
							nanocrystalline alloys for permeability-engineering gapless inductors.</p>

								<h3>Biography</h3>
								<p>Dr. Ruishu F. Wright is a Research Physical Scientist on the National Energy
									Technology Laboratory’s Functional Materials Team. She serves as Technical Portfolio
									Lead for Natural Gas Infrastructure FWP and Principal Investigator for multiple
									projects and coordinates R&D efforts of an interdisciplinary team to develop
									real-time sensors and functional sensitive materials to monitor and mitigate
									corrosion and gas leaks of natural gas pipelines, enable subsurface geochemical
									monitoring in support of subsurface hydrogen-natural gas storage, wellbore integrity
									monitoring of carbon storage wells, and plugging abandoned wells. Dr. Wright’s
									expertise lies in advanced sensors development for structural health monitoring and
									environmental detection for energy infrastructure using distributed and
									nondestructive sensor technologies to ensure safe, reliable and resilient
									infrastructure for, among other things, natural gas and hydrogen transportation,
									subsurface wellbores, CO2 storage systems, and plugged abandoned wells. She has
									extensive experience in design and development of functional materials (e.g.
									metallic thin films, metal oxides, nanomaterials) to enable various sensor
									platforms(e.g. fiber optic sensors, passive wireless sensors, electrochemical
									sensors). She also has strong expertise in corrosion and materials degradation in
									natural gas pipelines and in deep wells with extreme conditions, such as
									high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP) environments. Dr. Wright holds a Ph.D. from
									the Pennsylvania State University, and she has published more than 40 technical
									articles and given more than 30 presentations at conferences, and holds five pending
									and awarded U.S. patents on sensor technologies.</p>
